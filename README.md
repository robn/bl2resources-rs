A Rust wrapper over the Borderlands 2 assets library.

The resource files themselves are in resources/, and are probably not free to distribute. I include them here as a convenience. I originally got them from http://svn.gib.me/public/borderlands2/trunk/Gibbed.Borderlands2.GameInfo/Resources/ (parted of the [Gibbed Borderlands 2 save editor](http://blog.gib.me/category/games/borderlands-2/)), which in turn were extracted from the game itself.
